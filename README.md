# DB IO
A project to simulate multiple read/writes to SQL database.
## Initial Requirements
Two applications are needed, DB Writer and DB Reader. These should be separate applications and are expected to be able to run simultaneously.
    
- **DB Writer**:
  - This applicationâ€™s role is to process events and store them in an SQL database.
  - It should insert 1 new record into the database every `t` seconds with random values.
  - The structure of the various events is defined in a source, in this example the `type_mapping.json`.
  - The application should be able to handle additions of events and/or fields in this file.
  - The application must read the json and update the database schema accordingly if applicable.
  - Existing data previously created with a different type mappings should be preserved.
  - Any identical events that get processed should produce a single record in the database (no duplicate rows).
  - Should be easily scalable (having multiple instances).

- **DB Reader**:
  - This application must query the database `f` times per second.
  - Each query should be for a random event type and filter a random time frame between a start and end time.
  - Should be easily scalable (having multiple instances).

- General assessment factors:
  - The applications act as described. Correct Behavior.No crashes.
  - Database performance. Low RAM and CPU usage. Fast reads.
  - Readable. The codebase is easy to follow with comments where appropriate.
